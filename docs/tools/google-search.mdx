# Google Search Tool

The Google Search Tool is a custom tool that allows the Newsletter AI Agent to search the web for relevant information using the [Apify Google Search Scraper](https://apify.com/apify/google-search-scraper) actor.

## Overview

The Google Search Tool is primarily used by the [Researcher Agent](/agents/researcher) to gather general information about the specified topic. It provides a flexible interface for searching Google and extracting structured data from search results.

## Implementation

The Google Search Tool is implemented as a CrewAI `BaseTool` that interacts with the Apify Google Search Scraper actor. Here's the implementation:

```python
from crewai.tools import BaseTool
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, ConfigDict
from typing import List, Optional
from apify import Actor
from src.tools.base import RunApifyActor

class GoogleScraperInput(BaseModel):
    """Input schema for GoogleScraper tool."""
    queries: List[str] = Field(
        description="Search terms or Google Search URLs. Can use advanced techniques like 'AI site:twitter.com'. Limit 32 words per query."
    )

    resultsPerPage: Optional[int] = Field(
        description="Number of results to return per page",
        default=10
    )

    languageCode: Optional[str] = Field(
        default="en",
        description="Language for search results (passed as hl parameter)"
    )
    
    # Additional parameters...

class GoogleScraperTool(BaseTool):
    name: str = "Google Scraper"
    description: str = "Tool for scraping Google search results with configurable parameters"
    args_schema: type[BaseModel] = GoogleScraperInput
    actor: Actor = Field(description="Apify Actor instance")
    model_config = ConfigDict(arbitrary_types_allowed=True)
    
    def _run(
        self,
        queries: List[str],
        resultsPerPage: Optional[int] = 10,
        languageCode: Optional[str] = "en",
        # Additional parameters...
    ) -> str:
        run_inputs = {
            "queries": "\n".join(queries)
        }
        
        # Set additional parameters...
        
        run_actor = RunApifyActor(self.actor)
        dataset = run_actor._run("apify/google-search-scraper", run_inputs)
        return dataset
```

## Parameters

The Google Search Tool accepts the following parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `queries` | List[str] | Search terms or Google Search URLs | Required |
| `resultsPerPage` | int | Number of results to return per page | 10 |
| `languageCode` | str | Language for search results | "en" |
| `forceExactMatch` | bool | Wrap query in quotes for exact phrase matching | False |
| `site` | str | Limit search to specific site (e.g. site:example.com) | None |
| `relatedToSite` | str | Filter pages related to specific site | None |
| `wordsInTitle` | List[str] | Filter pages with specific words in title | [] |
| `wordsInText` | List[str] | Filter pages with specific words in text | [] |
| `wordsInUrl` | List[str] | Filter pages with specific words in URL | [] |
| `quickDateRange` | str | Filter by date range (e.g. d10, w2, m6, y1) | "d30" |
| `beforeDate` | str | Filter results before date (YYYY-MM-DD) | None |
| `afterDate` | str | Filter results after date (YYYY-MM-DD) | None |
| `fileTypes` | List[str] | Filter by file types | [] |
| `mobileResults` | bool | Return mobile version of search results | False |
| `includeUnfilteredResults` | bool | Include lower quality results | False |

## Usage

The Google Search Tool is used by the Researcher Agent to gather information about the specified topic:

```python
# Initialize the tool
google_tool = GoogleScraperTool(actor=actor)

# Use the tool
search_params = {
    "queries": [topic],
    "resultsPerPage": 5,
    "maxPagesPerQuery": 2,
    "languageCode": "en",
    "quickDateRange": "m1"  # Last month
}

web_results = google_tool._run(**search_params)
```

## Return Value

The tool returns a list of search results, where each result is a dictionary containing information about a search result, including:

- `title`: The title of the search result
- `url`: The URL of the search result
- `description`: A snippet of text from the search result
- `position`: The position of the result in the search results
- Additional metadata about the search result

## Apify Integration

The tool uses the Apify Google Search Scraper actor, which provides several advantages:

1. **Scalability**: The actor can handle large numbers of search queries efficiently
2. **Reliability**: The actor is designed to handle rate limiting and other issues that can arise when scraping search results
3. **Structured Data**: The actor returns search results in a structured format that is easy to process

## Configuration

To use the Google Search Tool, you need to set up the following environment variables:

```
APIFY_API_KEY=your_apify_api_key_here
```
