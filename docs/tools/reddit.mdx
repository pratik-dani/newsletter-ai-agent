# Reddit Scraper Tool

The Reddit Scraper Tool is a custom tool that allows the Newsletter AI Agent to gather discussions from Reddit using an Apify actor. It provides a way to collect community insights and discussions related to the specified topic.

## Overview

The Reddit Scraper Tool is primarily used by the [Researcher Agent](/agents/researcher) to gather community discussions about the specified topic. It provides a flexible interface for searching Reddit and extracting structured data from posts and comments.

## Implementation

The Reddit Scraper Tool is implemented as a CrewAI `BaseTool` that interacts with an Apify Reddit scraper actor. Here's the implementation:

```python
from crewai.tools import BaseTool
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, ConfigDict
from typing import List, Optional, Literal
from apify import Actor
from src.tools.base import RunApifyActor

class RedditScraperInput(BaseModel):
    """Input schema for RedditScraper tool."""
    searches: List[str] = Field(
        description="Here you can provide a search query which will be used to search Reddit's topics."
    )

    startUrls: Optional[List[str]] = Field(
        description="If you already have URL(s) of page(s) you wish to scrape, you can set them here. If you want to use the search field below, remove all startUrls here.",
        default=None
    )
    
    skipComments: Optional[bool] = Field(
        default=False,
        description="This will skip scrapping comments when going through posts"
    )
    
    # Additional parameters...

class RedditScraperTool(BaseTool):
    name: str = "Reddit Scraper"
    description: str = "Tool for scraping Reddit content with configurable parameters"
    args_schema: type[BaseModel] = RedditScraperInput
    actor: Actor = Field(description="Apify Actor instance")
    model_config = ConfigDict(arbitrary_types_allowed=True)
    
    def _run(
        self,
        searches: List[str],
        startUrls: Optional[List[str]] = None,
        skipComments: Optional[bool] = False,
        # Additional parameters...
    ) -> str:
        run_inputs = {}
        
        if searches:
            run_inputs["searches"] = searches
        if startUrls:
            run_inputs["startUrls"] = startUrls
        if skipComments:
            run_inputs["skipComments"] = skipComments
        # Set additional parameters...
        
        run_actor = RunApifyActor(self.actor)
        dataset = run_actor._run("reddit-scraper-actor-name", run_inputs)
        return dataset
```

| `searchComments` | bool | Search for comments with the provided search | False |
| `searchCommunities` | bool | Search for communities with the provided search | False |
| `searchUsers` | bool | Search for users with the provided search | False |
| `sort` | str | How to sort the results (e.g., "new", "top", "hot") | "new" |
| `time` | str | Time filter for results | None |
| `includeNSFW` | bool | Include NSFW content in results | True |
| `maxPostCount` | int | Maximum number of posts to retrieve | 20 |

## Usage

The Reddit Scraper Tool is used by the Researcher Agent to gather community discussions about the specified topic:

```python
# Initialize the tool
reddit_tool = RedditScraperTool(actor=actor)

# Use the tool
reddit_results = reddit_tool._run(
    searches=[topic],
    searchPosts=True,
    searchComments=False,
    sort="relevance",
    maxPostCount=10
)
```

## Return Value

The tool returns a list of Reddit posts and comments, where each item is a dictionary containing information about a post or comment, including:

- `title`: The title of the post (for posts only)
- `text`: The text content of the post or comment
- `url`: The URL of the post or comment
- `author`: The username of the author
- `score`: The score (upvotes - downvotes) of the post or comment
- `created`: The creation date of the post or comment
- Additional metadata about the post or comment

## Apify Integration

The tool uses an Apify Reddit scraper actor, which provides several advantages:

1. **Scalability**: The actor can handle large numbers of Reddit searches efficiently
2. **Reliability**: The actor is designed to handle rate limiting and other issues that can arise when scraping Reddit
3. **Structured Data**: The actor returns Reddit posts and comments in a structured format that is easy to process

## Configuration

To use the Reddit Scraper Tool, you need to set up the following environment variables:

```
APIFY_API_KEY=your_apify_api_key_here
```
