# Agents Overview

The Newsletter AI Agent uses a multi-agent system powered by [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI) to generate newsletters. This system consists of three specialized agents that work together to research, write, and edit the newsletter content.

## Agent Architecture

The agent system is implemented using CrewAI, which provides a framework for creating and coordinating multiple agents. Each agent has a specific role, goal, and set of tools that it can use to accomplish its tasks.

### Integration with Apify

The agents use tools that leverage [Apify](https://apify.com) actors for web scraping and data collection. Apify provides a platform for running web scraping and automation tasks at scale, which allows the Newsletter AI Agent to gather information from various sources efficiently.

The integration with Apify is implemented through a base class in `src/tools/base.py` that provides a standardized way to call Apify actors and process their results:

```python
class RunApifyActor:
    """Run an Apify actor and return the results."""
    def __init__(self, actor):
        self.actor = actor

    def _run(self, actor_name, run_input):
        # Implementation to run the Apify actor and return results
        # ...
```

## Agent Roles

The Newsletter AI Agent consists of three specialized agents:

### 1. Researcher Agent

The [Researcher Agent](/agents/researcher) is responsible for gathering information about the specified topic. It uses a set of tools to search the web, collect social media posts, find relevant videos, and gather news articles.

**Tools:**
- [Google Scraper Tool](/tools/google-search): Uses the Apify Google Search Scraper actor to search the web
- [Reddit Scraper Tool](/tools/reddit): Uses an Apify Reddit scraper actor to gather discussions
- [Twitter Scraper Tool](/tools/twitter): Uses the Apify Twitter Scraper Lite actor to collect tweets
- [YouTube Scraper Tool](/tools/youtube): Uses an Apify YouTube scraper actor to find videos
- [Google News Scraper Tool](/tools/google-news): Uses the Apify Super Fast Google News Scraper actor to gather news articles

### 2. Writer Agent

The [Writer Agent](/agents/writer) is responsible for transforming the research data into engaging newsletter content. It takes the information gathered by the Researcher Agent and creates a well-structured newsletter draft.

**Capabilities:**
- Content creation from research data
- Structuring the newsletter into sections
- Formatting the content in markdown
- Adding links to sources

### 3. Editor Agent

The [Editor Agent](/agents/editor) is responsible for reviewing and improving the newsletter draft. It ensures that the content is polished, error-free, and ready for distribution.

**Capabilities:**
- Grammar and spelling correction
- Style and tone consistency
- Fact-checking
- Formatting and layout improvement

## Agent Workflow

The agents work together in a sequential workflow to generate the newsletter:

1. The **Researcher Agent** gathers information about the specified topic
2. The **Writer Agent** transforms the research data into a newsletter draft
3. The **Editor Agent** reviews and improves the draft to create the final newsletter

This workflow is orchestrated by the `NewsletterCrew` class in `src/newsletter_crew.py`, which creates the agents, defines their tasks, and manages the flow of information between them.

## Agent Implementation

Each agent is implemented as a class in the `src/agents` directory:

- `src/agents/researcher.py`: Implements the Researcher Agent
- `src/agents/writer.py`: Implements the Writer Agent
- `src/agents/editor.py`: Implements the Editor Agent

The agents are created using CrewAI's `Agent` class, which provides a framework for defining an agent's role, goal, backstory, and tools.

## Configuration

The agent system can be configured through environment variables and configuration files:

- **Environment Variables**: Set API keys and other credentials in the `.env` file
- **Configuration Files**: Modify agent behavior in the `src/config` directory
