### Running the Actor via Apify API Client (Python)

```python
import os
from apify_client import ApifyClient

# Initialize the ApifyClient with your API token
client = ApifyClient(os.getenv('APIFY_API_KEY'))

# Start the actor and wait for it to finish
run = client.actor('your-username/newsletter-ai-agent').call({
    'topic': 'Latest advancements in quantum computing'
})

# Fetch the actor's output
output = client.dataset(run['defaultDatasetId']).list_items().items[0]
newsletter_content = output['content']

# Do something with the newsletter content
print(newsletter_content)
```

### Running the Actor via Apify API Client (JavaScript)

```javascript
const { ApifyClient } = require('apify-client');

// Initialize the ApifyClient with your API token
const client = new ApifyClient({
    token: process.env.APIFY_API_KEY,
});

// Start the actor and wait for it to finish
const run = await client.actor('your-username/newsletter-ai-agent').call({
    topic: 'Latest advancements in quantum computing',
});

// Fetch the actor's output
const { items } = await client.dataset(run.defaultDatasetId).listItems();
const newsletterContent = items[0].content;

// Do something with the newsletter content
console.log(newsletterContent);
```

## Actor Lifecycle

1. The actor initializes and loads environment variables
2. It processes the input parameters (using default if none provided)
3. It creates a NewsletterCrew instance with the necessary agents
4. The Researcher Agent gathers information about the topic
5. The Writer Agent transforms the research into a newsletter draft
6. The Editor Agent reviews and improves the draft
7. The final newsletter is returned as output

## Resource Usage

The Newsletter AI Agent performs web scraping and uses large language models, which can be resource-intensive. The actor typically takes 3-5 minutes to generate a newsletter, depending on the complexity of the topic and the amount of information available.
