# Newsletter AI Agent

The Newsletter AI Agent is a powerful tool designed to automatically generate newsletters about specific topics. It leverages CrewAI to orchestrate a team of specialized AI agents that work together to gather relevant information, organize it, and create a well-structured newsletter ready for distribution.

## Overview

This agent helps you stay informed about your areas of interest by:

1. Collecting the latest information on your specified topics
2. Organizing the content in a readable format
3. Generating a complete newsletter ready for distribution

## Key Features

- **Topic-based content gathering**: Specify your interests and let the agent find relevant information
- **Automated newsletter generation**: Transform raw information into well-structured newsletters
- **Customizable outputs**: Adjust the format and style of your newsletters
- **Agent-based architecture**: Leverages CrewAI to coordinate specialized agents for research, writing, and editing

## CrewAI Implementation

The Newsletter AI Agent uses [CrewAI](https://docs.crewai.com), a framework for orchestrating role-playing AI agents. Our implementation includes:

- **Researcher Agent**: Gathers comprehensive information about the specified topic from various sources
- **Writer Agent**: Transforms research data into engaging newsletter content
- **Editor Agent**: Reviews, improves, and finalizes the newsletter for publication

These agents work together in a sequential process, with each agent building upon the work of the previous one to create a high-quality newsletter.

## Custom Tools

The agents use custom tools to interact with external data sources:

- **Google Search Tool**: Searches the web for relevant information
- **Reddit Tool**: Gathers discussions from relevant subreddits
- **Twitter Tool**: Collects tweets related to the topic
- **YouTube Tool**: Finds relevant video content
- **Google News Tool**: Gathers the latest news articles
