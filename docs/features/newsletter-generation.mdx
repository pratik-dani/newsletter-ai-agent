# Newsletter Generation

The Newsletter AI Agent uses a sophisticated process powered by CrewAI to generate high-quality newsletters about specific topics. This page explains the newsletter generation process in detail.

## Generation Process

The newsletter generation process follows these steps:

1. **Topic Specification**: The user specifies a topic of interest
2. **Research**: The [Researcher Agent](/agents/researcher) gathers comprehensive information about the topic
3. **Writing**: The [Writer Agent](/agents/writer) transforms the research data into engaging newsletter content
4. **Editing**: The [Editor Agent](/agents/editor) reviews and finalizes the newsletter
5. **Output**: The final newsletter is returned to the user

## CrewAI Workflow

The newsletter generation process is implemented using CrewAI, which orchestrates the agents and their tasks. The workflow is defined in the `NewsletterCrew` class:

```python
def generate_newsletter(self, topic: str) -> str:
    # Create tasks for each agent
    research_task = Task(
        description=f"Research the topic '{topic}' and gather comprehensive information.",
        expected_output="Detailed research data in JSON format.",
        agent=self.researcher
    )
    
    writing_task = Task(
        description="Transform the research data into engaging newsletter content.",
        expected_output="Draft newsletter in markdown format.",
        agent=self.writer,
        context=[research_task]
    )
    
    editing_task = Task(
        description="Review and finalize the newsletter content.",
        expected_output="Final newsletter in markdown format.",
        agent=self.editor,
        context=[writing_task]
    )
    
    # Execute the tasks
    result = self.crew.kickoff(tasks=[research_task, writing_task, editing_task])
    
    return result
```

This workflow ensures that each agent builds upon the work of the previous one, creating a cohesive and high-quality newsletter.

## Agent Interactions

The agents interact with each other through the tasks' context. Each task has access to the output of its context tasks, allowing agents to build upon each other's work:

1. The Researcher Agent performs its task independently, gathering information about the topic
2. The Writer Agent receives the Researcher Agent's output as context for its task
3. The Editor Agent receives the Writer Agent's output as context for its task

This sequential process ensures that each agent has the information it needs to perform its task effectively.

## Customization Options

The newsletter generation process can be customized in several ways:

### Topic Customization

The most basic customization is specifying the topic of interest:

```python
from src.newsletter_crew import NewsletterCrew

crew = NewsletterCrew()
newsletter = crew.generate_newsletter("Artificial Intelligence")
```

### Section Customization

You can customize the sections included in the newsletter by modifying the `DEFAULT_NEWSLETTER_SECTIONS` in `src/config/config.py`:

```python
DEFAULT_NEWSLETTER_SECTIONS = [
    "Latest News",
    "Industry Updates",
    "Tools & Frameworks",
    "Companies & Startups",
    "Research & Development",
    "Community Discussions",
    "Video Content",
    "Podcasts",
]
```

### LLM Customization

You can customize the language model used by the agents by modifying the `LLM` initialization in `src/newsletter_crew.py`:

```python
self.llm = LLM(
    model="gemini/gemini-2.0-flash-lite",  # Change to another supported model
    temperature=0.7,  # Adjust for more or less creativity
    api_key=os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY"),
    verbose=False  # Set to True for more detailed output
)
```

## Output Format

The newsletter is generated in markdown format, which can be easily converted to HTML, PDF, or other formats. The markdown format includes:

- **Headers**: For section titles and article titles
- **Links**: For references to sources
- **Formatting**: For emphasis, lists, and other styling
- **Images**: For thumbnails and other visual elements

Here's an example of the output format:
