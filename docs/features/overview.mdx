# Features Overview

The Newsletter AI Agent offers a range of features powered by CrewAI to help you generate high-quality newsletters about specific topics.

## Core Features

### Agent-Based Architecture

The Newsletter AI Agent uses a multi-agent architecture powered by CrewAI:

- **[Researcher Agent](/agents/researcher)**: Gathers comprehensive information about the specified topic
- **[Writer Agent](/agents/writer)**: Transforms research data into engaging newsletter content
- **[Editor Agent](/agents/editor)**: Reviews and finalizes the newsletter

This agent-based approach allows each agent to specialize in a specific aspect of the newsletter creation process, resulting in better overall quality.

### Custom Tools

The agents use custom tools to gather information from various sources:

- **[Google Search Tool](/tools/google-search)**: Searches the web for relevant information
- **[Reddit Tool](/tools/reddit)**: Gathers discussions from relevant subreddits
- **[Twitter Tool](/tools/twitter)**: Collects tweets related to the topic
- **[YouTube Tool](/tools/youtube)**: Finds relevant video content
- **[Google News Tool](/tools/google-news)**: Gathers the latest news articles

### Automated Newsletter Generation

The Newsletter AI Agent automates the entire newsletter generation process:

1. **Topic Specification**: You specify a topic of interest
2. **Research**: The Researcher Agent gathers comprehensive information
3. **Writing**: The Writer Agent transforms the research data into engaging content
4. **Editing**: The Editor Agent reviews and finalizes the newsletter
5. **Output**: The final newsletter is returned to you

### Markdown Formatting

The Newsletter AI Agent generates newsletters in markdown format, which can be easily converted to HTML, PDF, or other formats. The markdown format includes:

- **Headers**: For section titles and article titles
- **Links**: For references to sources
- **Formatting**: For emphasis, lists, and other styling
- **Images**: For thumbnails and other visual elements

## Advanced Features

### Customizable Sections

You can customize the sections included in your newsletters by modifying the `DEFAULT_NEWSLETTER_SECTIONS` in `src/config/config.py`:

```python
DEFAULT_NEWSLETTER_SECTIONS = [
    "Latest News",
    "Industry Updates",
    "Tools & Frameworks",
    "Companies & Startups",
    "Research & Development",
    "Community Discussions",
    "Video Content",
    "Podcasts",
]
```

### LLM Customization

You can customize the language model used by the agents by modifying the `LLM` initialization in `src/newsletter_crew.py`:

```python
self.llm = LLM(
    model="gemini/gemini-2.0-flash-lite",  # Change to another supported model
    temperature=0.7,  # Adjust for more or less creativity
    api_key=os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY"),
    verbose=False  # Set to True for more detailed output
)
```

### CrewAI Integration

The Newsletter AI Agent is built on top of CrewAI, a framework for orchestrating role-playing AI agents. This integration provides:

- **Task Management**: CrewAI manages the tasks assigned to each agent
- **Agent Coordination**: CrewAI coordinates the interactions between agents
- **Context Sharing**: CrewAI enables agents to share context and build upon each other's work

### Extensibility
